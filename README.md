### Hi! I'm Aedan ðŸ‘‹
- I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience) at the University of Toronto, before heading to Western University for a BrainsCAN Postdoctoral Fellow (Computational Neuroscience). I'm now back to the University of Toronto as a Postdoctoral Fellow.
- My research involves multivariate statistical and machine learning methodologies to understand how memory works: using real-time virtual reality, mouse-tracking, and cutting-edge neuroimaging approaches.
