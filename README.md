### Hi! I'm Aedan 👋
- I completed my Ph.D. in Psychology (Cognitive Neuroscience) at the University of Toronto, before heading to Western University for a BrainsCAN Postdoctoral Fellowship (Computational Neuroscience). I went back to the University of Toronto as a Postdoctoral Fellow temporarily, before my current role as a Customer Experience Data Analyst at Intact.
- My research involves multivariate statistical and machine learning methodologies to understand how memory works: using real-time virtual reality, mouse-tracking, as well as cutting-edge neuroimaging and artificial neural networks.
